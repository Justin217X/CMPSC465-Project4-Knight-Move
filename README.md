# Traveling Knight Problem Solver

## Overview
This is a C++ program that solves the "Traveling Knight" problem on a standard 8Ã—8 chessboard. Given two squares (e.g., "a1" and "h8"), the program determines the minimum number of knight moves required to travel from the starting square to the destination square using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

## Project Information
- **Course**: CMPSC 465 Fall 2025
- **Author**: Justin Hued (jjh6734)
- **Due Date**: October 12, 2025
- **Language**: C++ (C++17)

## Project Structure
- `proj4.cpp` - Main program implementing the knight move solver
- `input.txt` - Input file containing pairs of chess squares
- `proj4` - Compiled executable (generated, excluded from git)

## How It Works
The program:
1. Reads pairs of chess squares from `input.txt`
2. Converts chess notation (a1-h8) to coordinates
3. Uses BFS to find the shortest path between squares
4. Outputs the minimum number of knight moves required

## Running the Program
The workflow automatically compiles and runs the program:
```bash
clang++ -std=c++17 -o proj4 proj4.cpp && ./proj4
```

## Input Format
The `input.txt` file contains pairs of chess squares, one pair per line:
```
e2 e4
a1 b2
b2 c3
a1 h8
```

## Example Output
```
To get from e2 to e4 takes 2 knight moves.
To get from a1 to b2 takes 4 knight moves.
To get from b2 to c3 takes 2 knight moves.
To get from a1 to h8 takes 6 knight moves.
```

## Recent Changes
