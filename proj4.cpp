 * Description: This program solves the "Traveling Knight" problem
 * on a standard 8Ã—8 chessboard. Given two squares from an input.txt
 * file (such as "a1" and "h8"), the program determines the minimum
 * number of knight moves required to travel from the starting square
 * to the destination square.
